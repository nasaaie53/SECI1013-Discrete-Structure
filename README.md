👨🏻‍🎓Section  : 02

## 📝Summarize

Discrete Structures is a core subject in Computer Science.
It provides the mathematical foundation for computing concepts.
Topics like logic and sets support programming and problem solving.
Graphs and trees are used in data structures and algorithms.
Boolean logic is important for digital circuits and conditions in code.
The subject trains logical and critical thinking skills.
Overall, it helps students understand how computer systems work.

## 🪞Reflection

In this course, I have learned a lot of mathematicial knowldege that somewhat related to computer science field. I can train my skiils in crictical thinking to solve mathematicial problem. I can understand the calculation methodes that required while doing the problem prediction.All in all,
everything in a computer including the images, videos, text are actually just a neatly arranged set of discrete numbers.
